    This logbook documents the work completed and knowledge gained across the CMP5329 labs, showcasing
    the use of a wide variety of security techniques and access control methods on a Linux OS\@.
    This logbook specifically covers the following labs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lab 1, covering OpenSSL\@.
        \item Lab 2, covering simple usage of GPG\@.
        \item Lab 5, covering the use of Linux Discretionary Access Control commands.
        \item Lab 6, covering password cracking.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent As per module specifications, screenshots taken in each lab
    include the date and time at which they were taken.\\

    \small
    With the world moving forward into an increasingly digital age, the security of data is paramount for
    corporations, businesses and general end-users alike.
    Sensitive data such as bank details and important corporate documents being stored on digital servers inspires
    countless threat agents to gain unauthorised access to all kinds of devices with each passing year.
    In 2016, the Identity Theft Resource Center and Cyber Scout reported 1,093 data breach incidents, up 40\%
    from the 780 reported in 2015~\autocite{DataBreaches}.\\

    \noindent It is for this reason that many strategies are employed to secure digital systems, such as cryptography.
    Cryptography is defined as the technique of obfuscating or coding data~\autocite{KSCryptography}, and often refers
    to encryption in a cybersecurity context, wherein data transmitted and stored on systems
    is encrypted as an additional layer of security that ensures data cannot be read by anyone other than its
    intended recipient, even if it is intercepted during transmission or stolen.
    Asymmetric encryption is especially important, as it allows for non-repudiation, which provides
    assurance to the sender that its message was delivered, as well as proof of the sender's identity to the recipient.
    As a result, neither the sender nor the receiver can deny the message was sent and received~\autocite{NR}.\\

    \noindent While cryptography is essential in the security and integrity of data, it does not come
    without some disadvantages of its own, especially on portable and/or older, low-performance devices.
    Constant encryption and decryption of data using strong encryption algorithms such as AES256 can be
    performance-intensive, causing these devices to lag.
    Additionally, an unavoidable consequence of the security provided by strong encryption is that the data
    cannot be recovered without the key.
    Though this is intentional, there are likely to be scenarios wherein a user has lost their key and therefore
    all of their encrypted data, as cracking stronger encryption methods is not feasibly possible with
    current computational power in finite time~\autocite{AESFinite}.\\

    \noindent An additional cybersecurity measure utilised across a wide variety of systems is access control.
    One variant of this known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC) was showcased and explained in detail
    in Lab~\ref{ch:lab5} of this logbook.
    Access control is defined as "an essential element of security that determines who is allowed to
    access certain data, apps, and resources."~\autocite{AccessControlMS}.
    By limiting user access to only what is strictly necessary, risk can be significantly mitigated due to
    users being unable to modify or delete data they are not entitled to, intentionally or not.\\

    \noindent Access control is also not without some issues of its own.
    Access control is predicated on authentication, meaning that if a threat agent were to gain access to an account
    with superior access than their own via methods such as phishing or password cracking via tools like Hashcat or
    John the Ripper, they could then access privileged data via impersonation.
    Additionally, access control is reliant upon authorisation, meaning that if access levels are not correctly
    set by administrators, it is possible that users could gain access to data without having to gain malicious
    access at all.\\

    \noindent These two techniques are typically used in conjunction with each other on the vast majority of
    IT systems, which is known as Cryptographic Access Control.
    This is a vastly superior option to using just one of these techniques, as each technique amplifies the other.
    Cryptography mitigates access control's impersonation drawback because account passwords
    would be hashed and salted, making them much harder to brute force.
    It can also assist in role-based access control, assigning keys dependent upon a user's role
    and associated privilege level.
    With the application of cryptographic access control, digital systems can be much more secure and robust
    in the face of constantly evolving threats.
