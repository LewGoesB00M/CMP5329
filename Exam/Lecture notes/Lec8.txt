The principles of cybersecurity are to uphold confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Confidentiality:
	Preventing unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, information either in transit or on a device ('at rest')
	Could be breached via:
		Social engineering
		Eavesdropping
		Captured network traffic (Wireshark)
		Password theft
		Data theft through unencrypted data.

	Can be upheld via:
		Encryption
		Data classification & labelling
		Access Control
		User security awareness training

Integrity:
	Preventing unauthorised or unintentional modification of data.
	Breached via:
		Viruses
		Unauthorised access
		Malicious modifications
		Hackers
		Backdoors

	Upheld via:
		Encryption
		Access Control
		Hash verification
		Intrusion detection systems
		User awareness training

Availability:
	Ensuring that data is available to authorised users as and when needed without interruption.
	Breached via:
		Device failures
		Environmental threats / 'Acts of God' (Earthquake etc.)
	
	Upheld via:
		Traffic monitoring
		Firewalls (Mitigate DoS/DDoS)
		Regular maintained backups
		Business continuity plans (Emergency prep plans like what to do in a 'doomsday scenario') <- Was examined in Y13.
