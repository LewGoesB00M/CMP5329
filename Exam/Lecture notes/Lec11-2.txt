The financial industry is a key target for any cybercriminal. Many threats exist that threaten it:
	Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)             Insider and internal threats
	DoS   						  Attacks of SWIFT systems (Facilitates international transactions)
	Mobile banking breaches                              Supply chain infiltration
	
It's essential that functions and assets of the system are identified alongside coutnermeasures to attacks against them via the use of frameworks such as
CIS18. The system should constantly be monitored, and security controls should be evaluated often, as threats constantly evolve.
A good security configuration is necessary, including boundary firewalls and internet gateways, access control systems, patch management and malware protection. Patch management in particular is quite worthwhile, as frequent updates allow for zero-days to be quickly nullified, an especially important measure for the financial industry.
