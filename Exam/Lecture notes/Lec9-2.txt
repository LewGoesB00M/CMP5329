This will absolutely be on your exam, no shadow of a doubt.

The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain is a framework for understanding adversary behaviour in a cyber-attack.
MITRE ATT&CK is MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge.

In this order:

Reconnaissance 
	Gathering information (NMAP, whois, social engineering)
	Can be detected via security systems such as firewalls, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and logging systems.

Weaponisation
	With the info gained from recon, exploits are created that use any found backdoor, and are then converted to deliverable malware payloads.
	Can be detected via antivirus and NIDS.

Delivery
	Delivery of malicious payload, via methods such as USB, phishing and/or malicious URLs.

Exploitation
	The exploitation of existing vulnerabilities such as the ones found in recon or known zero-days, or privilege exploitations where access control
	isn't as it should be and a user can do more than they should really be able to. 	

Installation
	Not much to say, just the execution of the payload I think.

Command & Control (or C2)
	Control is established, and the device connects to the attacker's server, where they could do thinks like RCEs or data theft.

Actions on objectives
	Exfiltration of stolen data, and maintaining a foothold over the device to possibly do it again at some point


MITRE ATT&CK 
	There's a massive zoomed out image on slide 36 about this.
	In summary, it defines the typical behaviours of threat agents in each stage of their attack.
	There are over a hundred of these, they can't possibly expect you to remember them all?
