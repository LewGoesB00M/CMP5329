Viewing permissions in Linux is possible via ls -l.
(UNTESTED) It might return "rwx rwx rwx" for example, stating that all users (owner, group & all users) can read, write and execute it.

Chmod modifies permissions to an access group:
	u - Owner
	g - Group
	o - Others
	a - All users

Chmod a +rwx message.txt - ALLOWS ALL USERS to READ, WRITE & EXECUTE the file MESSAGE.TXT.
Chmod a -rwx message.txt - FORBIDS ALL USERS to READ, WRITE & EXECUTE the file MESSAGE.TXT.

It also has number arguments on Slide 28.
Chmod 777 is rwx for all.
Seems to be the following - 	N1      N2         N3
			         Owner  Group   Others

The sum of set numbers defines the permissions. R = 4, W = 2, X = 1.
So RWX is 4+2+1 = 7.
Chmod 750 is:
	Owner - RWX
	Group - RX
	Others - None

It might be pronounced as "change mode?"


Chown assigns a new owner to a file. 
Chown bob:boys1 message.txt assigns message.txt's owner as user Bob and group boys1.

You can add a user with adduser, a group with addgroup, and assign a user to a group with usermod -a -G [group] [user]
											    usermod -a -G sudo bob
