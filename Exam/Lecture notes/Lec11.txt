Data breaches must be reported to relevant authorities within 72 hours.

UK DPA 2018:
	Largely in line with EU's GDPR, which stopped applying to the UK from January 1st 2021.
	Empowers people with the control of their data, allowing requests for access & deletion, but not necessarily for free unless the records in question 													concern credit, health or education. The price is maxed at Â£10.
	Created new offences for dealing with emerging threats.
	Places the duty on the data controller to notify the Data Commissioner and the individual concerned within a data breach.
	Data controllers and processors exclusively based in the UK may be required to appoint an EU representative.

	Enforced by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) who also oversee acts such as the Freedom of Information Act.
	The ICO have a register of all data controllers, and mandate that any organisation processing personal data must register with them.
	Complaints can be made to the ICO who will then perform investigations. 

GDPR:
	Improves data protection within EU member states and internationally by introducing major restrictions on the processing of data concerning EU 																	citizens, even outside of the EU.
