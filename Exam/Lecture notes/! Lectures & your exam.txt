It's likely that everything here will appear in some way on the exam. Antonio mentioned at the start of W7 lecture that the lectures will be more
specialised to the exam, so it's likely that you'll want an abundance of knowledge on week 7 onwards. It almost sounds a bit like things before week 7 won't be examined at all, but you can't trust that to be true.

Week 8 will absolutely be present, and probably every single aspect covered in it.

One question will be on Week 9 - risk assessments.
The question in the week 9 lab exercise is similar to the one that'll be in your exam.
You'll have to identify the assets, threats, impacts and create risk documentation for it, including a matrix and overall risk assessment.
The lab sheet shows how it should be done.

I'm not sure how you can do some of that stuff on the DigiExam platform (presumably the one being used)

Could be worthwhile to look back on your skipped labs - I believed they were totally optional but Week 9's lab changes that a bit.
