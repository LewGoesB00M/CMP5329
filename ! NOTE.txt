Lab 2:

! You may notice that in some bash commands, "gpg" and "gpg1" are used interchangeably. This was due to an issue I was facing in this lab with a GPG incompatibility, solved by installing GNUPG,
which uses the command "gpg1".                         ^ Go through and redo it so that gpg is never used. Seen in image 14.

Lab 2/3:

-r flag when transferring the message specifies its recipient. So when you put -r bob, you're saying "encrypt with bob's public key". Obviously needs 
the active user to acknowledge bob's key by having imported and signed it.

Lab 3:

Instead of signing the key, TRUST the key by saying trust.



Anywhere that you're using a private key, the passphrase is the user's name. Applies to all passwords too.
Base64 encoding == ASCII encoding. That's why it's -a.
