Lab 2:

! You may notice that in some bash commands, "gpg" and "gpg1" are used interchangeably. This was due to an issue I was facing in this lab with a GPG incompatibility, solved by installing GNUPG,
which uses the command "gpg1".                         ^ Go through and redo it so that gpg is never used. Seen in image 14.

Lab 2/3:

-r flag when transferring the message specifies its recipient. So when you put -r bob, you're saying "encrypt with bob's public key". Obviously needs 
the active user to acknowledge bob's key by having imported and signed it.

Lab 3:

Instead of signing the key, TRUST the key by saying trust.



Anywhere that you're using a private key, the passphrase is the user's name. Applies to all passwords too.
Base64 encoding == ASCII encoding. That's why it's -a.

"It looks really good, you'd get full marks. Add a paragraph comparing asymm and symm encryption in
lab 1."

^ As above, re-added some of the content pre-reduction to address that.

Reflective report had some slight sentence flow change.

Reflective report is now "Reflective Report on Cryptography and Access Control" since it
apparently wasn't inherently clear, with formatting added to ensure it sticks to one page.

Draft text removed, title page now official.

Added note about LaTeX navigability.

Corrected some spelling mistakes.
TODO: You must read through the entire thing, ensuring there aren't more of them.

TODO: Redo Lab 5 using photos directory.
TODO: Perhaps find an additional source for your final paragraph.
